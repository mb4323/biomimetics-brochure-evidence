# The Grip of The Octopus

Below are video demonstrations of the Augmented Reality feature for our brochure, as well as a direct link to the website we created for the brochure, and a link to the Github repo behind the website.

## The Augmented Reality Experience

The brochure contains two QR codes: one on the front page and one on the unfolded interior. Scanning these QR codes, and subsequently holding the brochure in front of the camera, opens the augmented reality brochure on the user's phone. Demonstrations of this are shown below.
 
### Front Page

## The Website

The website is linked on the back of the brochure under the last QR code. The website shows multimedia assets, the main original research paper, citations, and further reading for those interested in learning more.
